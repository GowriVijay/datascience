Hi!  My name is Ralph Brooks, and I am a data scientist based out of Dallas, TX. I am currently looking for new career opportunities. If I can be of assistance to you or if I can provide additional information, feel free to contact me at ralph_brooks@yahoo.com. 


As an introduction to my background, feel free to take a look at my resume at : https://github.com/ralphbrooks/datascience/blob/master/Resume/Ralph-Brooks-Resume.doc?raw=true


Some examples of my technical skills include the following: 

BIG DATA

* Hadoop with R - Use of big data within R in order to examine average airport delay times

MICROSOFT T-SQL

* SQL to pull data from SQL Server 2008 - This slightly complex query pulls and aggregates customer data from a number of different tables (using several with statements and left joins)
